#Codesters
----

The plan is to make a platform for students to help them learn, share and collaborate on Computer Science projects. Students who want to learn programming or web development can do so via tracks. We do not intend to write another [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/) like site, rather we want to become a library/recommendation hub for beginners. Tracks will include links to the most recommended tutorials/courses on the open web. We are primarily aiming Indian students now.

##Version 1 feature expectations

+ User accounts with achivements.
+ Users can share any link of interesting blog post or video or tutorial.
+ Upvoting of these links will make it revelant for others to use it.
+ Moderators can create tracks to let learn beginners programming and other concepts.
+ Users can do separate lessons from track of their choice.


##Technologies Used

+ Django 1.4.5
+ PostgreSQL (sqlite3 for dev)

*For full requirements, see requirment.txt*
